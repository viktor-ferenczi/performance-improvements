# Space Engineers Performance Improvements Plugin

## Features

- `MySpinWait` optimization (lower CPU consumption during heavy load, but potentially higher simulation wall clock time)
- Suppressing useless updates during grid merge and paste (about twice as fast for grids with lots of terminal blocks)
- Reducing CPU load of network statistics updates (saves ~50% constant load on a CPU core)

**Please see below** for the technical details and the **Keen bug tickets to vote on**.

More optimizations are planned.

## Prerequisites

- [Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/) with [Plugin Loader](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2407984968) or
- [Torch Server](https://torchapi.net/) or
- [Dedicated Server](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/dedicated-servers/)

## Installation

### Client plugin

1. Install [Plugin Loader](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2407984968) into Space Engineers (add launch option)
2. Enable the **Performance Improvements** plugin from the **Plugins** dialog
3. Apply, restart the game

### Torch Server plugin

Select the **Performance Improvements** plugin from the plugin list inside the Torch GUI.

Please note, that the plugin is using Harmony to patch the game code. Once Keen fixes the issues 
these patches are expected to be removed anyway, so I did not bother using Torch's patching mechanism.

### Dedicated Server plugin

1. Download the latest ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/performance-improvements/releases).
2. Open the `Bin64` folder of your Dedicated Server installation.
3. Create a `Plugins` folder if it does not exists.
4. Extract the ZIP file into the `Bin64/Plugins` folder.
5. Right click on all the DLLs extracted and select **Unblock** from the file's **Properties** dialog.
6. Start the Dedicated Server.
7. Add the `PerformanceImprovements.dll` from the `Bin64/Plugins` folder to the Plugins list.

## Technical details

### SPINWAIT (both client and server)

Replaces `MySpinWait.SpinOnce` with more energy efficient code, which consumes less CPU time
while waiting on locks to be released. While it reduces CPU consumption (and some cache misses),
it does not make anything completing any faster (no measurable difference).

### MERGE_PASTE_UPDATES (server and offline games)

Disables the `MyConveyorLine.UpdateIsWorking` method while any grid merging operation is in
progress. It considerably reduces the merge time of grids with long conveyor systems. At the
end of `MyCubeGrid.MergeGridInternal` it calls `GridSystems.ConveyorSystem.FlagForRecomputation()`
on the grid to force recalculating all `IsWorking` values to fix any side-effects of the
optimization.

It also sets `MySession.Static.m_updateAllowed` to `false` while `MyCubeGrid.PasteBlocksServer`
is running. It eliminates a lot of unnecessary computations until the paste is done.

These two fixes combined make grid merge and paste operations ~60-70% faster in my test world,
at least for grids with lots of terminal blocks and conveyor ports.

### NETWORK_STATISTICS (client only)

Eliminates 98% of the ~50% constant CPU core load imposed by the
`VRage.EOS.MyP2PQoSAdapter.UpdateStats` method, even during **offline** games.
It is done by replacing 49 out of 50 calls with a `Thread.Sleep(1)`.
It limits the outer loop's frequency to less than 1000/s and spends
less CPU power on gathering statistics.

It makes the game faster only if you have 4 or less CPU cores, since this
method is called repeatedly in a loop on its own thread. It still helps to
reduce CPU power consumption and cache misses if you have more than 4 cores.

Whether it affects the stability of multiplayer networking or any other EOS
related functionality is yet to be seen.
